# Object Detection using YOLOv3

## Overview
This project implements an object detection system using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model. The system is capable of identifying and localizing objects in real-time within images or video streams. YOLOv3 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm that is known for its speed and accuracy.

## Features
- Real-time object detection
- High accuracy with YOLOv3
- Capable of detecting multiple objects in a single frame
- Easy to use and extend

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the chosen implementation)
- YOLOv3 pre-trained weights and configuration files

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-yolov3.git
   cd object-detection-yolov3
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download YOLOv3 weights and configuration files**
   - Download the YOLOv3 weights from the official YOLO website: [YOLOv3 Weights](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
   - Place the `yolov3.weights` file in the `weights/` directory.
   - Download the configuration file `yolov3.cfg` and place it in the `cfg/` directory.
   - Download the COCO names file `coco.names` and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

### Detect objects in an image

1. **Run the object detection script**
   ```bash
   python detect_image.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

2. **Output**
   - The script will process the input image, detect objects, and save the output image with bounding boxes around detected objects in the `outputs/` directory.

### Detect objects in a video

1. **Run the object detection script for video**
   ```bash
   python detect_video.py --video_path path/to/your/video.mp4
   ```

2. **Output**
   - The script will process the input video, detect objects frame by frame, and save the output video with bounding boxes around detected objects in the `outputs/` directory.

## Configuration

- **Adjusting detection threshold**
  - You can adjust the detection confidence threshold by modifying the `conf_threshold` variable in the script files. This value determines the minimum confidence score for a detected object to be considered valid.
  ```python
  conf_threshold = 0.5  # Default is 0.5
  ```

- **Changing input size**
  - The input size of the YOLOv3 model can be adjusted by modifying the `input_size` variable. YOLOv3 typically uses 416x416 or 608x608 input dimensions.
  ```python
  input_size = 416  # Default is 416
  ```
